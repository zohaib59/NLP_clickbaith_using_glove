# Clickbait Title Detection using Deep Learning & Classical ML

A hybrid deep learning and classical machine learning project that detects **clickbait headlines** using text classification. 
The system preprocesses text, uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings, and compares GRU, LSTM, ANN, and traditional ML models for performance.

##  Project Highlights

- Text preprocessing with **SpaCy**
- Word embedding using **GloVe**
- Deep learning models: GRU, LSTM, ANN (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, MLPClassifier, Random Forest
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization of training and validation accuracy

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- SpaCy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas, NumPy
- GloVe embeddings (`glove.6B.100d.txt`)



Clickbait headlines are everywhere. What if we could **detect them with AI**?

I just completed a project where I built a hybrid system combining deep learning and classical machine learning to **detect clickbait** in article titles!

 Technologies used:
- TensorFlow / Keras (GRU, LSTM, ANN)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, MLP, Random Forest)
- SpaCy for NLP
- GloVe embeddings for word vectors

I trained and evaluated multiple models, visualized performance, and compared deep vs classical approaches.
This was a great exercise in text preprocessing, embeddings, and model interpretability.
